# sendgrid_teammate (Resource)

Provides a Teammate resource.

Teammates is an account administration and security tool designed to help manage multiple users on a single SendGrid account. Teammates is built for groups of shared users, where each user has a different role and thus requires access to different SendGrid features.

For more detailed information, please see the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/glossary/teammates).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sendgrid_teammate" "example" {
  email = "dummy@example.com"
  scopes = [
    "user.profile.read",
    "mail_settings.read",
    "partner_settings.read",
    "tracking_settings.read",
    "user.account.read",
    "user.credits.read",
    "user.email.read",
    "user.profile.update",
    "user.settings.enforced_tls.read",
    "user.timezone.read",
    "user.username.read",
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) Teammate's email
- `scopes` (Set of String) The permissions API Key has access to.

For more detailed information, please see the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/teammate-permissions#persona-scopes)

The following Scopes are set automatically by SendGrid, so they cannot be set manually:`2fa_exempt`, `2fa_required`, `sender_verification_exempt`, `sender_verification_eligible`. A teammate remains in a pending state until the invitation is accepted, during which scopes cannot be modified.

**Important:** The following scopes cannot be assigned when inviting a teammate and will cause an error:`user.profile.update`, `user.password.update`

These scopes can be added after the teammate accepts the invitation. To work around this limitation:
1. First invite the teammate without these scopes
2. After the teammate accepts the invitation, update their permissions to include these scopes

Please note that SendGrid API behavior may change without notice.
If you encounter any issues, feel free to report them via [issues](https://github.com/i10416/terraform-provider-sendgrid-plus/issues).

### Optional

- `is_admin` (Boolean) Set to true if teammate has admin privileges.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `username` (String) Teammate's username. If the username you provide is already associated with an existing SendGrid account or teammate, the request will fail.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
% terraform import sendgrid_teammate.example <teammate's email>
```
