## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of API Key

### Optional

- `scopes` (Set of String) The permissions API Key has access to.

The following Scopes are set automatically by SendGrid, so they cannot be set manually:

- sender_verification_exempt
- sender_verification_eligible
- 2fa_required

### Read-Only

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API Key. NOTE: If imported, you cannot set the value of the API key. This is because the API key is issued only during the creation process.
- `id` (String) The ID of API Key

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
% terraform import sendgrid_api_key.example 1234567890AbCdEfGhIjkL
```
