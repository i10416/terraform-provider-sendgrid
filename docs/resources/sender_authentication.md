# sendgrid_sender_authentication (Resource)

Provides a Sender Authentication resource.

Sender authentication refers to the process of showing email providers that SendGrid has your permission to send emails on your behalf.

```terraform
resource "sendgrid_sender_authentication" "example" {
  domain = "example.com"
}

output "ips" {
  value = sendgrid_sender_authentication.example.ips
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `domain` (String) Domain being authenticated.

### Optional

- `custom_dkim_selector` (String) Add a custom DKIM selector. Accepts three letters or numbers.
- `default` (Boolean) Whether to use this authenticated domain as the fallback if no authenticated domains match the sender's domain.
- `subdomain` (String) The subdomain to use for this authenticated domain.

### Read-Only

- `dns` (Attributes Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dns))
- `id` (String) The ID of the authenticated domain.
- `ips` (Set of String) The IP addresses that will be included in the custom SPF record for this authenticated domain. NOTE: even if it adds the associated IP when executing the domain authentication API, the response returns an empty list of IPs, which causes a difference with the value set by terraform, so IP association/detachment is not supported.
- `legacy` (Boolean) Whether to use this authenticated domain as the fallback if no authenticated domains match the sender's domain.
- `user_id` (Number) The ID of the user that this domain is associated with.
- `username` (String) The username associated with this domain.
- `valid` (Boolean) Indicates if this is a valid authenticated domain.

<a id="nestedatt--dns"></a>
### Nested Schema for `dns`

Read-Only:

- `data` (String) The DNS record.
- `host` (String) The domain that this DNS record was created for.
- `type` (String) The type of DNS record.
- `valid` (Boolean) Indicated whether the CName of the DNS is valid or not.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:
